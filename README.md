# Image Classifier

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognise different species of flowers. I used this dataset of 102 flower categories. Link to download the data can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.

This project can be easily genaralised to train on another labelled photo dataset.

In the Jupyter Notebook I demonstrate the trained model. The end of the notebook implements the model on images downloaded from Google Images. The training code can be seen in the .py files in the repository here and is implemented via a command line application.
